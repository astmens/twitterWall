# twitterWall
Sample task:
for displaying tweets and pictures of multiple queries merged into one timeline. 
The user should be able to configure multiple queries using *search text*, *geocode* and *language*. 
These settings should then stored in the local storage in order to survive a page reload. 
For simplification of task, results are retreived from proxy server.
